            <h2>Aspects of Chess</h2>
            <p>
              Chess is a complicated game. However, though the end goal of each
              game is to win, it can be broken down into manageable chunks.
              <br />
              Some of the more important areas involved in a chess game are
              listed bellow.

              <h3>Middlegame/Chess Theory</h3>
              <p>
                There is no clear line between the opening and middlegame, and
                between the middlegame and endgame. In modern chess, the moves
                that make up an opening blend into the middlegame, so there is
                no sharp divide. Simply put, the middle game begins when both
                players have completed the development of all or most of their
                pieces and the king has been brought to relative safety.
                However, at master level, the opening analysis may go well into
                the middlegame. Factors such as control of the center are less
                important in the endgame than the middlegame. In endgames the
                number of pieces and pawns is much reduced, though even after
                queens are traded, one may talk about a "middlegame without
                queens." The endgame is often said to begin when the kings can
                safely play an active role. Theory on the middlegame is less
                developed than the opening or endgames. Since middlegame
                positions are unique from game to game, memorization of
                theoretical variations is not possible as it is in the opening.
                Likewise, there are usually too many pieces on the board for
                theoretical positions to be completely analyzed as can be done
                in the simpler endgames.

              <h3>Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                Formulation of chess positions and setting of goals and
                long-term plans for future play. While evaluating a position
                strategically, a player must take into account such factors as
                the relative value of the pieces on the board, pawn structure,
                king safety, position of pieces, and control of key squares and
                groups of squares (e.g. diagonals, open files, and individual
                squares). Chess strategy is distinguished from chess tactics,
                which is the aspect of play concerned with the move-by-move
                setting up of threats and defenses. Some authors distinguish
                static strategic imbalances (e.g. having more valuable pieces or
                better pawn structure), which tend to persist for many moves,
                from dynamic imbalances (such as one player having an advantage
                in piece development), which are temporary.[1] This distinction
                affects the immediacy with which a sought-after plan should take
                effect. Until players reach the skill level of "master", chess
                tactics tend to ultimately decide the outcomes of games more
                often than strategy does. Many chess coaches thus emphasize the
                study of tactics as the most efficient way to improve one's
                results in serious chess play.

              <h3>Openings</h3>
              <p>
                A chess opening or simply an opening refers to the initial moves
                of a chess game. The term can refer to the initial moves by
                either side, White or Black, but an opening by Black may also be
                known as a defense. There are dozens of different openings, and
                hundreds of variants. These vary widely in character from quiet
                positional play to wild tactical play. In addition to referring
                to specific move sequences, the opening is the first phase of a
                chess game, the other phases being the middlegame and the
                endgame.

              <h3>Evaluation/Calculation</h3>
              <p>
                Calculation is a deliberate process that transforms one or more
                inputs into one or more results, with variable change. In this
                case, In chess, the term is used to assess the possibilities of
                a position and judge whether a move is sound in the long and
                short term. To calculate means to determine material or
                positional quality a move or series of moves.

              <h3>Tactics</h3>
              <p>
                A tactic refers to a sequence of moves that limits the
                opponent's options and may result in tangible gain. Tactics are
                usually contrasted with strategy, in which advantages take
                longer to be realized, and the opponent is less constrained in
                responding. The fundamental building blocks of tactics are move
                sequences in which the opponent is unable to respond to all
                threats, so the first player realizes an advantage.
              </p>

              <h3>Endgame</h3>
              <p>
                The stage of the game when few pieces are left on the board.
                Pawns become more important as endgames often revolve around
                attempting to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank.
                The king, which has to be protected in the middlegame owing to
                the threat of checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame.
                It can be brought to the center of the board and act as a useful
                attacking piece.
